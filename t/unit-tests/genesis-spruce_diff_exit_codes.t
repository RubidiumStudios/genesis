# `spruce diff` exits 0 when the files match, 1 when they differ, and 2 or
# more when it cannot compare them.  Genesis runs it under script(1) so the
# diff keeps its colours, and the two script(1)s report that code
# differently.  macOS `script -e` passes the child's code through, while
# util-linux `script` without -e always exits 0 and records the real code in
# the "Script done" trailer of its typescript.
#
# The cloud config check in `genesis deploy` and the job spec comparison in
# `genesis compare-kits` used to read the code straight from script(1).  On
# macOS any cloud config change then aborted the deploy with an empty
# "Error comparing cloud configs:" message, and on Linux a spruce failure was
# shown as a set of differences.  Both now go through spruce_diff, which
# reads the real code on either platform.
#
# Fake script and spruce commands on PATH reproduce each platform's
# behaviour, so every path runs on any host.
